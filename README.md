# Sqlalchemy-challenge (Week 10 HW) - Surfs Up!

Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! \
To help with your trip planning, you need to do some climate analysis on the area and design an API based on queries you create. \
Bonus: Further Temperature Analysis

### Process
Used Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. All of the following analysis was completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Additionally, a Flask API was designed based on the queries developed. Further analysis was completed in Jupyter Notebook to view various climate and termperature factors.
